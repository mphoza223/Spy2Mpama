ðŸ‘‰ This is an Ionic V1 and Three.js project ðŸ‘ˆ
The authors assume that you know your way around ionic v1. Ionic V1 is no longer supported by Ionic officially but they still provide a way to compile ionic v1 projects

install Ionic v1 (see https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/v1-ionic-and-cli/90258)
Go to the root folder and run "npm i" (make sure you have node.js and npm installed on your machine)
Then compile the project to get the apk
